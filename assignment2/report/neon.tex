\subsection{NEON}
\subsubsection{Function Analysis}
To implement NEON version of gaussian\_smooth function, the feature of the function is analyzed first to determine how NEON can be utilized to
realize the function. In this function, blurring operations are performed twice, the first operation is based on x direction and the other is based on y direction of the image. Due to the similarity of the operations, only the first operation is analyzed in this section. 
The nature of Gaussian blur is to convolve the image with Gaussian function. In the original application,
