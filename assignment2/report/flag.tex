\subsection{Optimization flags}

The following compiler flags are used to performs optimizations during the compilation of source code:

\begin{itemize}
\item{O3:} it provides the highest level of optimization of code for the execution time and code size.
\item{mtune=cortex-a8:} it tunes the generated code to run faster on \emph{cortex-a8} than any other processor of same architecture.
\item{march=armv7-a:} This option takes the CPU name \emph{armv7-a} and allows the gcc to generate a code that uses all the features of that family.
\item{mfloat-abi=softfp:} it specifies which floating point \emph{Application Binary Interface} (ABI)to use. By specifying \emph{mfloat-abi=softfp}, allows \emph{gcc} to generate code by using the hardware floating point units, but still using the \emph{soft-float} calling convention.
\item{mfpu=neon:} This specifies what floating-point hardware (or hardware emulation) is available on the target.
\end{itemize}

Moreover, we have used \emph{ftree-vectorize}, \emph{ffast-math} and \emph{fomit-frame-pointer} flags during the compilation but did not get any speedup because these flags are implicitly enabled if the \emph{-O3} optimization flag is used.
