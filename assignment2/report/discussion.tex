Several changes could be made to the current application that could possibly improve the results even more.
First of all, further optimization are possible within the DSP and the NEON block. 
For instance in NEON, floating point calculations are used at the moment. But more speedup can be achieved by using fixed-point calculations because in general fixed-point calculations are faster than floating-point calculations.
Secondly, other functions could possibly be computed in parallel as well.
i.e. The \textit{non\_max\_supp() \& apply\_hysteresis()} are the next computationally intensive applications taking 8\% and 5\% each respectively.
Even more, simply utilizing NEON in those functions could potentially speed up the overall implementation.
