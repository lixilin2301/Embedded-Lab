Several changes could be made to the current application that could possibly improve the results more.
First of all, further optimization are possible within the DSP and the NEON block. Secondly, other functions could possibly be computed in parallel as well.
i.e. The \textit{non\_max\_supp() \& apply\_hysteresis()} are the next computationally intensive applications taking 8\% and 5\% each respectively.
Even more, simply utilizing NEON in those functions could potentially speed up the overall implementation.
