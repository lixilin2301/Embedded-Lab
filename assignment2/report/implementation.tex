\section{Implementation}
Obtaining the results from profiling we see that approximately 80\% of the time is spent on executing the \textit{gaussian_smooth} function. Observing the code of this function we see that it is divided into for loops. First the blurring is done in the X-direction and then in the Y-direction by applying the gaussian kernel.
