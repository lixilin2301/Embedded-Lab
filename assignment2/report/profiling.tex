\section{Profiling}
\label{sec:profiling}
The space and timing complexity of the any application is measured by the profiling. In this assignment, MCProf profiling tool is being used for the profiling of the  \emph{Canny Edge Detection} application. MCProf is a  runtime Memory and Communication profiler which generates detailed application profile in terms of memory access patterns and data-communication at function and loop-level granularity. we did  profiling  of this application for the given sample pictures and realized that gaussian-smooth function consumes almost 80\% of the processing time for each input picture. Moreover,for each picture most of the memory accesses is also done from this function. Therefore, we decided to accelerate this function. The profiling results for the \emph{tiger.pgm} input image is shown in the  following diagrams. 

The profiling results of the rest of the pictures are attached in the appendix
