\section{Introduction}

\textbf{A lot of this can still be reused,  We should also mention "hardware software co-design" somewhere here}


The purpose of this assignment is to improve a sequential version of an image processing algorithm on a multi-core heterogeneous computing platform provided. The given platform is the Beagle Board\footnote{http://beagleboard.org/} that has a general purpose ARM processor (from now on referred to as the \emph{GPP}) and a digital signal processor (\emph{DSP}) that would be used in this lab for -------- and eventually obtaining a speed up by performing computations in parallel. Luckily the heavily used gaussian filtering function could be load balanced amongst different processing units due to its very little data dependancy. \textbf{bla bla bla..... }


In this report we will go through describing each component and the communication model that we have come up with to communicate our matrix structures in the heterogeneous environment. We will see that the communication has overhead and imposes additional delays. Furthermore every core has a hardware limitation in terms of how many operations can be performed at the same time, which defines the upper bound on how much speed-up can be obtained. At last results and their discussion is shown as well as a section on future improvements.
