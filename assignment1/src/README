Compiling
=========
Either use the upload.sh script for convenience, or make (and make send) both the gpp and dsp files manually.

Running
=======
The 'test.sh' script can be uploaded to the executable directory as well and run. This will run the program for matrix sizes 1 to 128 automatically to test.

You can also run it yourself the normal way. The parameters have been altered to the following:

	./helloDSP helloDSP.out <matrix_size>

or upload the modified 'run.sh' script and run it like:

	./run.sh <matrix_size>
