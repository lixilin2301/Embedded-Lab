\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this assignment is to perform matrix multiplication on a multi-core heterogeneous computing platform. The given platform is the Beagle Board\footnote{http://beagleboard.org/} that has a general purpose ARM processor (from now on referred to as the \emph{GPP}) and a digital signal processor (\emph{DSP}) that would be used in this lab for matrix multiplication and eventually obtaining a speed up by performing computations in parallel. Luckily matrix multiplication has a large number of multiplication and addition operations that can be parallelized. In this report we will go through describing each component and the communication model that we have come up with to communicate our matrix structures in the heterogeneous environment. We will see that the communication has overhead and imposes additional delays. Furthermore every core has a hardware limitation in terms of how many operations can be performed at the same time, which defines the upper bound on how much speed-up can be obtained. At last results and their discussion is shown as well as a section on future improvements.
