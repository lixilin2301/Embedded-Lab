\section{Conclusion}
Overall, implementing a highly parallelizable algorithm on a machine capable 
of SIMD instructions with an additional DSP is discussed. Because there is a 
lot of communication overhead in a static solution, the acquired speed-up is 
fairly low for lower input sizes. When the input size grows, this gets closer 
to the theoretical upper-bound as defined by Amdahl's Law.
